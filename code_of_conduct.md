You are adults, so act like it. Try to resolve issues yourselves first. Don't make project [admins](https://github.com/orgs/Softhyena/teams/administration/members) or [moderators](https://github.com/orgs/Softhyena/teams/moderators/members) have get involved without trying to resolve it yourselves first, or it will not end well.

Rules:
1. Use common sense.†
2. Don't try to be offensive.
3. Don't try to be offended.

We don't care what you post on your social media, or what your views are, just don't represent us when doing so. (This also means don't harass people over their views)

† If you have to be told what common sense is, just follow [GNU kind](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/kind-communication.en.html). While GNU kind isn't *our* code of conduct, if you can't figure out what common sense is, you best just follow it instead.
